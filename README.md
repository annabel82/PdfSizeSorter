# PdfSizeSorter
Organises PDF files into various folders based on physical size.
This program requested by a friend and implemented chiefly as a learning exercise.

Currently only tested to build on MacOS Sierra but I see no reason for it to not build on other platforms.

Utilises Qt and poppler libs for UI and reading pdf files.
