# PdfSizeSorter
Organises PDF files into various folders based on physical size.
This program was requested by a friend and implemented chiefly as a learning exercise.

Currently I have only tested compiling on MacOS Sierra, but I see no reason for it to not build on other platforms.

Utilises Qt and poppler libs for UI and reading pdf files; you must install the poppler-qt5 libs before compiling.
